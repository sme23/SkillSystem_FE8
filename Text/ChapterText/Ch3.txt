[ML]
Lua. How goes the planning?[AN]
[MR][3LB]
As well as it can, I suppose.[AN]
The crew's grown fairly large,[N]
so there's a lot more paperwork[N]
to deal with and loot to dole out.[AN]
Desiderio's handling the lion's share[N]
of it, but that still leaves all this.[AN]
[ML]
Mm[Beat] My condolences. Anyway,[N]
I came here to give you a report.[AN]
So far, the journey's been smooth.[AN]
But the weather indicates a storm[N]
is coming for us within the hour.[AN]
Our ships are well-equipped for it,[N]
thanks to Rahel and her carpentry,[N]
but we still need to be vigilant.[AN]
[MR]
Thanks, Pilar. Hm[Beat] I should've[N]
known that flying into the Old World[N]
wouldn't be so easy, but still[Beat][AN]
[ML]
It is as you say; the primary reason[N]
the Old World is ill-known comes[N]
from the numerous storms around it.[AN]
Truthfully, the one coming towards[N]
us appears relatively mild for the[N]
region. Certainly not a tempest.[AN]
[MR][2LB]
Then I guess I can't complain, huh?[AN]
We can handle it. If we couldn't,[N]
then you'd have warned us off, right?[AN]
[ML]
Of course. The problem lies in what[N]
comes after we make it through, Lua.[AN]
[MR]
What do you mean by that?[AN]
[ML]
[Beat]You'll see soon enough.[AN][X]

[FarRight][LoadLua]
[L]
C-Captain Lua, there's big trouble![N]
We have to get out of here, now![AN]
[FR]
Calm down, Rahel.[N]
What's the situation?[AN]
[FL][3LB]
Just a few friends behind us, is all.[N]
Ones bearing T.O.R.C.H. flags.[AN]
I hoped that all of our misadventures[N]
in the outskirts threw them off our tail,[N]
but it seems that was wishful thinking.[AN]
[FR][2LB]
When you say few, how many?[AN]
[L]
There was one really big ship,[N]
and about four smaller ones.[AN]
They definitely outnumber us.[AN]
[FR]
They did at Port Greagor too,[N]
but we all know what happened there.[AN]
That said, we're not on our own turf,[N]
so we won't have the advantage here.[AN]
[FL]
Continuing to flee is still an option,[N]
one that I would personally recommend.[AN]
I am a merchant at heart, not a fighter.[AN]
[R]
Turning our backs to them only allows[N]
them to chase us into the Old World.[AN]
Lua, I recommend that we use the storm[N]
to our advantage and take them out.[AN]
[FR][ToggleSmile]
Good, at least someone's got some moxie.[N]
I was thinking the same thing, Pilar.[AN]
With a storm comes rain and thunder,[AN]
so let's make use of that to hide[N]
our movements and surround them.[AN]
Then, all we have to do is take their[N]
commander's head, and we'll win.[A]
[R][ToggleSmile]
That is[Beat] a rather bold plan,[AN]
but it works. I can helm one ship[N]
and bring whoever to accompany me.[AN]
[FR][3LB]
Good. Orlando, I'd ask you to take[N]
the other ship, but you'd probably[N]
run off with it when I'm not looking.[AN]
[FL]
Ah, such a harsh rebuke, Lua![AN]
Do you truly think I would abandon[N]
you all in your time of need?[N]
[Beat]Actually, you don't need to answer.[AN]
I suspect it'll only hurt my feelings.[A]
[FR]
[Beat]More importantly, Desiderio's got[N]
more respect from the others than you.[AN]
His boatsmanship could still use work,[N]
but it's good enough for this job.[AN]
Pilar, pass on these instructions to him,[N]
will you? We'll need his strength. And[Beat][N]
Tell Desiderio that I'm counting on him.[AN]
[R]
[Beat]Heh, of course.[N]
Good luck, Lua,[N]
and may we meet again.[A][X]

## Ch3BeginningScene1_3

[Left][LoadRahel]
[MR][LoadLua]
[MR][3LB]
And for the rest of you[Beat][N]
I'll decide on the groups in advance[N]
that'll support each squad leader.[AN]
This'll likely be our hardest battle yet,[N]
so I don't want to hear any complaining.[AN]
[L]
Hey, what are you looking at me for?![AN]
I'm a pirate now, so the captain's word[N]
is absolute. I won't let you down, got it?[AN]
[FL]
Well, you really took to it fast, Rahel.[N]
As for me[Beat] I would rather not die,[N]
so I suppose I can listen to you, Lua.[AN]
[MR]
Good, I'm counting on you two,[N]
and everyone else in the crew.[N]
[Beat]Now, how do I tell Razvan?[A][X]

//dalila and alonso talk and then realize they are being surrounded

## Ch3BeginningScene2
[MidLeft][LoadDalila]
[MidRight][LoadAlonso]
[ML]
What do you want, Alonso?[N]
I'm a little busy right now.[AN]
[MR]
Does a captain need a reason[N]
to chat with his first mate?[AN]
[ML]
[Beat]No, but you always have one.[AN]
Just make it quick, alright?[AN]
[MR]
Cold as always, eh Dalila?[AN]
Fine, fine, I won't waste your time.[N]
How's that Scorpio comin' along?[AN]
[ML]
The basic setup is finished.[AN]
It'll shoot any flier out of the sky,[N]
and hurts everybody else just fine.[AN]
Could use some more fine tuning,[N]
but it'll do its job well enough.[AN]
[MR]
Glad to hear it. Somethin' tells me[N]
we'll be needin' it sooner than later.[AN]
We can't rely on T.O.R.C.H. to get the[N]
job done, not the way we want it done.[AN]
[ML]
That's why we never should've joined[N]
T.O.R.C.H. and listened to their rules.[AN]
Weren't you always the one who said that[N]
anyone who crossed us would get theirs?[AN]
[MR]
[Beat]Are you doubtin' my decision, Dalila?[N]
Do you think you'd have chose better?[AN]
[ML]
[Beat] [Beat][AN]
[MR]
Good. You're the only one who's got the[N]
stones to give me a piece of their mind.[AN]
I can't have you goin' soft on me,[AN]
not before we finish the job[N]
and get back to our old ways.[AN]
[ML]
Huh? But[Beat] you signed us up to be[N]
privateers. Government lapdogs.[AN]
What's with the change of heart?[A]
[MR]
I did that because we didn't have[N]
the power to hunt Lua's crew ourselves.[AN]
Would you have had me look the other way,[N]
when we can't even give Khazhak a burial?[AN]
[ML]
[Beat]No, I wouldn't. But even so,[N]
I can't see any way back to the old days.[AN]
If we betray Incendivis's government now,[AN]
the T.O.R.C.H. rats that are watching[N]
our every move won't let us off lightly.[AN]
[MR]
Mm. And even if we kill those bastards,[N]
they won't stop hunting us after that.[AN]
The freedom we prided ourselves in[N]
is nothin' more than a mirage[Beat][AN]
That's what you're thinkin', right?[AN]
But I wouldn't have signed that contract[N]
if I couldn't think of a way out of it.[AN]
Have I ever steered us wrong before?[AN]
[ML]
[Beat]No, you haven't.[AN]
[MR]
That's right, and I'm not startin' now.[AN]
The first problem is all these T.O.R.C.H.[N]
on my boat[Beat][A] but we've got a friend[N]
comin' who'll fix that, any second now.[AN]
[ML]
You don't mean[Beat] Lua?[AN]
[MR]
The enemy of my enemy isn't my friend,[N]
but she's a nice pawn on the board.[AN]
One that ain't gonna wait for us[N]
to chase her, if my guess is right.[AN]
Follow my orders, and we'll make it[N]
through this, just like always.[AN]
[Beat]Do you trust me, Dalila?[AN]
[ML]
[Beat]My belief in you hasn't changed,[N]
not once since we first met.[AN]
You can rely on me, Alonso.[N]
Let's win back our freedom![A][X]

## Ch3BeginningScene3_1
[MidLeft][LoadAlonso]
[MidRight][LoadLua][3LB]
We've got you surrounded,[N]
so don't try flying away.[N]
Hm, you're no T.O.R.C.H. officer[Beat][AN]
Then you must be Alonso, captain[N]
of the Blackhearts. Am I right?[A]
[ML]
I see Nicodemus did his job, then.[N]
Good, that means I don't need[N]
to explain why I'm here to kill ya.[AN]
I won't be satisfied til you and[N]
the rest of your crew all get the[N]
same burial you gave to Khazhak![AN]
[MR]
Ha[Beat] hahaha! Sorry, it's just hard[N]
to take you seriously when you're[N]
leading the scummiest crew around.[AN]
Do you think you have the right[N]
to avenge anyone, Alonso?[AN]
[ML]
Keep laughin', but I know what I am,[N]
and I've got no problem admittin' it.[AN]
Lootin', ransom, murder, you name it,[N]
I've done it with a smile on my face.[AN]
But some pirates, like you lot,[N]
get real uppity about morals[N]
when we're all bilge in the end.[AN]
If you want something, take it.[N]
If you hate someone, kill them.[N]
Ain't that the way life should be?[AN]
[MR]
[Beat]We're criminals, not monsters.[N]
Any target of mine deserves their dues,[N]
and everyone else is off limits.[AN]
That's how I've always lived my life,[N]
even before I became a pirate,[N]
and I'm not changing that now.[AN]
For all the crimes you've committed[Beat][N]
I'll be the one to pass your sentence.[N]
Don't expect any clemency from me![A]
[ML][ToggleSmile]
Gahahaha! You've got some moxie, woman.[N]
I like that. Let's stop yappin', then,[N]
and get to killin' each other already.[AN]
[Beat]Just don't die before you reach me,[N]
after all that talk of yours, [OQ]hero[CQ]![A][X]

## Ch3BeginningScene3_2
[MidLeft][LoadRazvan]
[MidRight][LoadLua]
[ML]
W-What are those platforms, captain?[N]
They're linking all of the ships![A]
[MR][3LB]
Looks like they're hovering the same[N]
way that airships do, but I've never[N]
seen anything like it before.[AN]
Must be some kind of T.O.R.C.H. tech[N]
that Alonso got by bending the knee.[AN]
We won't be able to retreat until we[N]
can undo these links, since they're[N]
freezing all of our ships in place.[AN]
[ML]
Right. I'd bet that Alonso has some[N]
sort of key to undeploy this device,[N]
but it won't be easy to reach him.[AN]
And[Beat] if we take too long, Elodia[N]
may show up as well. That would be[Beat][AN]
[MR]
Our doom. We're sitting ducks like this,[N]
and I'd bet any remaining forces that[N]
T.O.R.C.H. has will be too much for us.[AN]
We can't take too long, and we can't rush[N]
either, with how entrenched Alonso is[Beat][N]
This'll be our hardest battle yet.[AN]
All crew, make for the center boat![N]
Let's take the Blackhearts down,[N]
once and for all. Follow my lead![A][X]

## Ch3BeginningScene3_3Razvan
[ML][LoadRazvan]
Yes, captain! I'll do my best to[N]
answer your faith in me, I swear it![A][X]

## Ch3BeginningScene3_3Pilar
[ML][LoadPilar]
Move carefully, everyone.[AN]
We're almost to our destination,[N]
so fight and survive another day![A][X]

## Ch3BeginningScene3_3Desiderio
[ML][LoadDesiderio]
Alonso? I knew that was the name of the[N]
Blackhearts captain, but to think[Beat][AN]
Well, it doesn't matter now.[AN]
If he's standing in our way,[N]
then I'll kill him myself![AN][X]

## AlonsoVictoryText
[MidLeft][LoadAlonso][ToggleSmile][3LB]
Heh, I didn't think she'd last[Beat][N]
But I always come out on top![AN]
Blackhearts, can you see that ship[N]
flyin' so gracefully towards us?[AN]
I would've liked to kill that wench[N]
myself, but this'll do well enough.[AN]
Lua, you hear me? It's over![AN][X]

## LuaDefeatText
[MidRight][LoadLua][3LB]
Hell[Beat] I wasn't fast enough,[N]
everyone. The Pirate Hunter's[N]
really got us, this time[Beat][AN]
There's no way out of this one.[N]
You all trusted me, and I failed.[N]
There's nothing I can do but apologize.[AN]
That, and take on the responsibility[N]
myself for this failed operation.[AN]
A captain goes down with the ship,[N]
right? Best of luck to you all.[N][.4][CloseEyes]
And[Beat] see you on the other side.[A][X]

Phew, it looks like we won.[AN]
That was one tough battle,[N]
but good work, Captain Lua![AN]
[R][3LB]
Mm[Beat] Something feels off, though.[AN]
Pilar, Razvan. Gather the others[N]
and start sawing the bridges off[N]
of the main ship just in case.[AN]
[L][2LB]
A prudent choice.[N]
Let's go, Razvan.[AN]
[FL]
R-Right![AN]

Desiderio, you're with me.[N]
Let's see what Alonso has to say.[AN]

You got it, boss![A][X]

[FL]
Not sure I'm gonna hold out, boss.[N]
Is[Beat] Is this the end for us?[AN]

Not even close, Dalila.[AN]

We'll make it through, like always.[AN][CSS]

[FR][LoadDesiderio]

Give it up, Alonso. You're through.[AN]
Whatever agreement you had with[N]
Elodia won't save you from me.[AN]
But what might is your cooperation.[AN]
Answer my questions, and you may[N]
just survive to live another day.[AN]
[ML]
You think I can't see the hate[N]
in your eyes, woman? Not likely.[AN]
The moment I tell you what I know,[N]
I'll have a bullet in my gut.[AN]
[FR]
You've smartened up a bit since[N]
we were both in the Roseblades, huh?[AN]
Still, if you don't tell us anything,[N]
then you'll have worse coming to you.[AN]
[ML][3LB]
Pah[Beat] Looks like you're still a dog,[N]
Desiderio, and not your own master.[N]
Too afraid to make the hard calls?[AN]
[FR]
Makes no difference to me, so long[N]
as me and my captain see eye to eye.[N]
Now, are you gonna comply, or not?[AN]
[ML][1LB]
[Beat]Ask your questions, and we'll see.[AN]
[R][3LB]
This technology you've used to lock us[N]
here[Beat] Why did T.O.R.C.H. give it[N]
to you? Surely, they don't trust you.[AN]
[ML]
Heh! Well, the feeling's mutual there.[AN]
If I had to guess, they hoped we'd kill[N]
each other enough so that they could[N]
finish the job. Worked well, didn't it?[AN]
Just like they wanted, us pirates[N]
are killin' each other instead of them.[AN]
[R]
[Beat]Don't put our crews in the same boat.[N]
I don't need any incentive to kill a man[N]
like you, so they wasted their money.[AN]
[ML]
That so? Must be hard to talk to me,[N]
from atop that high horse of yours.[AN]
You think you're some executioner,[N]
but lemme tell ya somethin', Lua.[AN]
You keep sayin' you do what's right,[N]
but no matter how much good you do,[N]
the empire's eyes only see our sins.[AN]
From their view, we're both just[N]
lawbreakers who need to be put down.[N]
Why not just embrace that label?[AN]
[R]
You're right. If the government[N]
had its way, both of us would be dead.[AN]
But my moral compass didn't vanish from[N]
moving to the wrong side of the law.[AN]
Whether the empire wants me dead or not,[N]
I'll keep doing what I think is right.[N]
That's what it means to be a pirate![AN]
[ML]
[Beat]Damn, I knew you were a do-gooder,[N]
but just hearing you makes me sick.[AN]
Well, at least you're a talker.[N]
Thanks to that, I bought just enough[N]
time. Why don't you look around, Desi?[AN]
[FR][2LB]
[Beat]Lua, there's a large armada headin'[N]
this way. It must be the Pirate Hunter![AN]
[R]
Damn it, I should've seen this[N]
coming. You're dead, Alonso![AN]
[ML][ToggleSmile]
Oh, I don't think so![AN]
Blackhearts, open the trapdoor.[N]
We're flyin' out of here![AN][X]

What the[Beat]? They fell down there.[N]
Is that a tiny airship I'm seein'?[AN]
[R]
Makes for a hell of an emergency exit[Beat][AN]
That bastard's craftier than I thought.[N]
We can't waste any time finishing him,[N]
not with T.O.R.C.H. so close to us.[AN]
For now, let's get back to the main ship[N]

Miss Elodia's on the way, then[Beat][N]
Yes, the ship is free, Captain Lua.[N]
We can leave at any time![AN]
[FarRight][2LB]
It's a lucky thing that this one[N]
has all our essential supplies,[AN]
since there's no way we'll have[N]
time to secure the other two.[AN]
But now that I'm lookin' around,[N]
where the hell can we even go?[AN]
In front of us are hellish gales,[N]
and behind us are T.O.R.C.H. hounds.[AN]
[Left]
One of these will kill us certainly,[N]
and the other will kill us possibly.[AN]
Our path forward is clear. Right, Lua?[AN]
[Right][3LB]
Of course, we fly into the storm.[AN]
It's not the first time we've gambled[N]
with our lives, and if I can help it,[N]
it won't be the last. Well, Pilar?[AN]
Any islands nearby that we can land on?[N]
We can't outrun that armada forever.[AN]
[Left]
I know of a few. Let me take the wheel,[N]
and I'll do the best that I can, Lua.[AN]
No promises that our landing will be[N]
smooth, though. We might just crash[N]
and have to hope for the best.[AN]
[FarRight]
I'll get everybody into the saferoom.[N]
It should be secure enough to survive[N]
a crash, so long as it ain't too bad.[A][CSSCF]
[FarLeft]
Oh Maker, please get us through this[Beat][N]
Captain, can I go with Desiderio[N]
to heal any of our injured crewmates?[AN]
In the event of a crash, outstanding[N]
injuries could turn fatal, even with[N]
the fortification in that room.[AN]
[R]
Of course, Razvan.[N]
I'll be there soon,[N]
so get going, alright?[AN]
[FL][1LB]
Y-Yes, captain![A][CSSCF]
[R][3LB]
[Beat]Pilar, one more thing before I go.[N]
Don't stay in the pilot's room any[N]
longer than you have to, understand?[AN]
Now, more than ever, we're going to need[N]
you, so don't try to play the hero.[AN]
[L][2LB]
Heh[Beat] Worried about me, Lua?[N]
The Lands Below must have frozen over.[AN]
Anyway, I have no intention of dying,[N]
so don't concern yourself with me.[AN]
I may be old, but I've got plenty[N]
left to do until I finally croak.[AN]
[R]
[Beat]Right. Well, stay safe.[AN]
We'll keep the door open for you,[N]
so don't make us wait, Pilar![A][CSSCF]
[L]
[Beat]Now, time to get to work.[AN]
Let's hope my old friends[N]
haven't turned on me[Beat][AN][X]

//They reach the island, but the engine shuts down just as they're going down to land.
//Lua orders everyone to get below deck and prepare for the crash, praying that they'll all survive!

we'd both be standin' here[N]
ready to kill each other.[AN]
This is how it was meant[N]
to be[Beat][A] So let's end this,[N]
here and now! Come at me![AN][CSSCF]
[MR]
Don't have to tell me twice![AN]
The Blackhearts die today,[N]
Alonso! And you with them![A][X]

## Ch3AlonsoDesiderioBQ
[MidRight][LoadDesiderio]
Looks like you're still[N]
kickin', Alonso. Gotta say,[AN]
I thought a rat like you[N]
woulda died in some alley.[AN][CSSCF]
[MidLeft][LoadAlonso]
And you are[Beat]?[N]
Ah, I remember you now![AN]
You were a member of that[N]
fool's crew. Desiderio![AN][CSSCF]
[MidRight][LoadDesiderio]
That's my name. Honestly,[N]
even though you're a scumbag,[AN]
I always respected your grit.[N]
But I've got a job to do.[AN]
You can choose whether I do[N]
it the easy way, or the hard-[AN][CSSCF]
[MidLeft][LoadAlonso]
How about neither? Let me[N]
do you a favor, instead;[AN]
I'll send ya to the same[N]
place your captain is![A][X]

## Ch3AlonsoOrlandoBQ
[MidLeft][LoadAlonso]
An old man, really?[AN]
Lua must be runnin' out[N]
of bodies if you're here.[AN][CSSCF]
[MidRight][LoadOrlando]
Ah, what an original insult![AN]
I must say, you're the[N]
embodiment of wit, friend.[AN]
Perhaps you'd like to share[N]
your jokes with my crew?[AN][CSSCF]
[MidLeft][LoadAlonso]
Oh, I get it! You're stallin'[N]
for time. Not bad, geezer,[AN]
but I'm not fallin' for that.[AN]
Lemme give you an early[N]
retirement, right now![AN][CSSCF]
[MidRight][LoadOrlando]
Just try it, if you can.[AN]
I haven't lived this long[N]
to die to a man like you![A][X]

## Ch3AlonsoCarmenBQ
[MidLeft][LoadAlonso]
Oh? You're in Lua's crew?[AN]
Honestly, you don't look[N]
much like a pirate, lass.[AN][CSSCF]
[MidRight][LoadCarmen]
Correct, I am no mere pirate.[N]
I am a musician! A virtuoso![AN]
And unlike you, Captain Lua[N]
appreciates my many talents.[AN][CSSCF]
[MidLeft][LoadAlonso]
[Beat]Really? She's an odd duck,[N]
but that's stranger still.[AN]
Well, with the way you're[N]
dressed, you must be rich.[AN]
How about I take you hostage[N]
and see if anyone cares?[AN][CSSCF]
[MidRight][LoadCarmen]
Hmph! Even if I could return,[N]
I found a place to belong.[AN]
Captain Lua believed in me[Beat][AN]
Now, I will repay that faith.[N]
Listen, boar, to your requiem![A][X]

## Ch3AlonsoXimoBQ
[MidRight][LoadXimo]
You must be the boss of the[N]
Blackhearts. Alonso, right?[AN][CSSCF]
[ML][LoadAlonso]
'Course I am. And you[Beat][AN]
Well, you just look like[N]
an ordinary bloke, huh?[AN]
I could find ten losers like[N]
you in any ol' port town.[AN][CSSCF]
[MidRight][LoadXimo]
Heh, you're right.[N]
Or you used to be, anyway.[AN]
But Captain Lua taught me how[N]
to be someone more than that.[AN]
People trust me now to do big[N]
things, to get the job done[Beat][AN]
I'm not gonna let them down.[N]
You're just target practice![A][X]

## Ch3AlonsoErnestBQ
[MidRight][LoadErnest]
Alonso[Beat] So, you're the same[N]
guy from the Roseblades, hm?[AN]
Now I see why the captain[N]
kicked you from the crew.[AN]
She must have seen how[N]
rotten you really were.[AN][CSSCF]
[ML][LoadAlonso]
No, she was afraid that[N]
I'd take her place![AN]
Look at all the people[N]
that I've gathered here.[AN]
Every last one of them?[N]
A lowlife, without question.[AN]
I've taken them under my[N]
wing and changed their lives.[AN]
Now, they have a place;[N]
now, they have a purpose![AN]
That's the mark of a leader,[N]
uh[Beat] Whoever you are.[AN]
And your captain feared that.[AN][CSSCF]
[MR]
Ernest. Regardless, you're[N]
delusional as always.[AN]
These Blackhearts follow you[N]
without question, right?[AN]
And if they do otherwise,[N]
then they lose their place,[AN]
forced to return to their[N]
meaningless everyday lives.[AN]
That means you're no leader;[N]
you're a tyrant, Alonso![AN]
And unlike my captain,[N]
I will not abide it.[AN]
I'll end this charade,[N]
right here and right now![A][X]

## Ch3DalilaPilarBQ
[MidLeft][LoadDalila]
What do you want, old-timer?[N]
Get moving, or I'll shoot.[AN][CSSCF]
[MidRight][LoadPilar]
Do you have eyes, girl?[N]
I have a knife in my hand.[AN]
Take this seriously,[N]
or you'll find it in your gut.[AN][CSSCF]
[ML][LoadDalila]
Heh[Beat] Am I supposed[N]
to be scared of you?[AN]
I grew up in a shithole town[N]
with nothing to live for.[AN]
Every day, all I could do[N]
was survive til the next one,[AN]
but then Alonso came along.[AN]
He pulled me out of that[N]
place and gave me a new life.[AN]
Here, I'm needed, wanted.[N]
Even if I die here to you,[AN]
I'll have served my purpose[N]
to him and the whole crew.[AN]
That's all that matters![AN][CSSCF]
[MidRight][LoadPilar]
[Beat]Is that so? I pity you.[AN]
You're no more than a puppet[N]
who can't see her strings.[AN]
You could be so much more[Beat][AN]
But if that's how you wish[N]
to live your life, so be it![AN][X]

## Ch3DalilaRazvanBQ
[MidRight][LoadRazvan]
You[Beat] I remember you![AN]
You led a group of Blackhearts[N]
in raiding a marine ship.[AN]
I couldn't fight back,[N]
so you spared my life,[AN]
but you killed everyone else[N]
and left me alone, stranded.[AN]
Does that ring any bells?[AN][CSSCF]
[ML][LoadDalila]
[Beat]Too many to count.[AN]
I have no idea who you are[N]
or when this happened,[AN]
but if you want an apology,[N]
then you'll be disappointed.[AN]
Honestly, you should thank me.[AN]
If it was Alonso leading it,[N]
you wouldn't be standing here.[AN]
[OQ]No loose ends[CQ], he says[Beat][N]
I should have listened.[AN][CSSCF]
[MidRight][LoadRazvan]
Yes, you should have listened.[N]
Not to him, your conscience![AN]
Whatever shred of it you had[N]
that made you spare me[Beat][AN]
Let me thank it and apologize.[AN]
Because now, I'm no longer[N]
defenseless.[A] I'm no longer[N]
alone, crying out for justice![AN]
And I will no longer tolerate[N]
devils like you in this world![A][X]

## Ch3DalilaRahelBQ
[MidRight][LoadRahel]
Wow, that's a neat ballista![N]
Did you make it yourself?[AN]
I've always wanted one that[N]
I could use on horseback,[AN]
but they're all so heavy[Beat][AN]
That one seems pretty light,[N]
though. It's impressive work![AN][CSSCF]
[ML][LoadDalila]
Uh, thanks? Why are you talking[N]
to me right now, exactly?[AN]
You know we're enemies, right?[AN][CSSCF]
[MidRight][LoadRahel]
Huh? Oh, I couldn't help[N]
myself when I saw it.[AN]
It's a bit of a shame that[N]
we have to fight each other[Beat][AN]
But it's either you or me,[N]
and I'm always picking me![AN][CSSCF]
[ML][LoadDalila]
[Beat]This is why I hate talking[N]
to people. Once you like them,[AN]
it gets harder to do this[Beat][AN]
But I've got no choice.[N]
Alonso's orders are absolute![A][X]

## Ch3DalilaFataBQ
[MidLeft][LoadDalila]
I've got you in my sights[Beat][AN]
There's nowhere to run,[N]
so don't bother trying.[AN][CSSCF]
[MidRight][LoadFata]
Bah, I'm not running![AN]
The dog you sent after Lua[N]
came biting at my heels, too.[AN]
Nicodemus was his name.[AN]
He brought a battle to[N]
my home and angered me,[AN]
enough for me to fight again.[N]
He disturbed my peace![AN][CSSCF]
[MidLeft][LoadDalila]
What? Gods below, I knew[N]
he was completely useless[Beat][AN]
Look, I'll let you walk away.[AN]
It's not like you're our[N]
target, so if you do,[AN]
I won't come after you.[AN][CSSCF]
[MidRight][LoadFata]
Oh, it's far too late for that![N]
You awoke a firestarter, girl.[AN]
Don't be surprised when[N]
you get burned![A][X]
