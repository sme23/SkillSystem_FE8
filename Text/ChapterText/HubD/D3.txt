[MidLeft][LoadLua][3LB]
[Beat]Hm. Yeah, no doubt about it.[N]
This place's infested with T.O.R.C.H.[N]
goons. Must be using it as a base.[AN]
[MR]
Given the chaos that's broken out[N]
ever since the islands began to fall,[AN]
it makes sense that imperials would[N]
seek shelter and await new orders[Beat][N]
Captain, did you see any bandits?[AN]
[ML]
Some. They're not far from town,[N]
but nobody's moving any closer.[AN]
Probably don't want to tangle[N]
with an imperial regiment.[AN]
[MR]
Foul vultures[Beat] Still, it seems that[N]
my fears were unwarranted, thankfully.[AN]
[Beat]Before we leave, I have a request.[N]
Do you mind if I go into town[N]
and give my mother a message?[AN]
[ML]
Go ahead. Make it quick, though:[N]
the longer you stay, the greater[N]
chance someone'll notice your bounty.[A]
[MR]
Right. I won't take long.[A][X]

[MidRight][LoadRazvan][3LB]
Um, excuse me[Beat] You two[N]
are Fane and Ivan, right?[AN]
[FL]
We are. Who's asking[Beat][N]
Wait one damn second![N]
Ivan, ain't that Razvan?[AN]
[Left]
Reckon so. It's been darn near[N]
five years since we saw you,[N]
boy! What are you doing here?[AN]
[MR]
I was in the area, and[Beat][N]
I feared that the Redwings might[N]
try to strike, in all the chaos.[AN]
[FL][ToggleSmile]
Oh, they have! But we've made it[N]
through, thanks to the T.O.R.C.H.[N]
and Incendivis folks stayin' here.[AN]
Them bandits got whipped so bad[N]
that now they're just lickin'[N]
their wounds out there, heh![AN]
[MR]
I'm glad to hear it. In that case,[N]
I'd better not stay much longer.[N]
I assume you know about my bounty?[AN]
[L][ToggleSmile]
Yeah, we do. Your ol' mother about[N]
keeled over when she saw that poster[Beat][N]
You ain't even gonna see her, Razvan?[AN]
[MR]
[Beat]I can't risk it, not with imperials[N]
swarming the town. If you can, though,[N]
please leave her a message from me.[AN]
That I'm doing just fine, and that[N]
I'll come home as soon as I can.[AN]
[FFL][LoadEnrique]
Is that what you think?[N]
Not on my watch, outlaw.[AN]
[FL]
O-Oh, shit! It's the T.O.R.C.H.[N]
boss. We'd better get outta here![AN]
[L]
We'll pass on your message,[N]
but you'd better leave, Razvan![AN][X]

## HubD3BeginningScene3
[ML][LoadEnrique]
[MR][LoadRazvan][3LB]
[ML]
[Beat]You look just like your mother, boy.[N]
She's quite the lovely lady: a shame[N]
that her son is such a disappointment.[AN]
[MR]
I don't suppose that I can convince[N]
you to let me go? I mean no ill will[N]
to you or any of your soldiers, sir.[AN]
[ML]
Ah, what a well-mannered pirate you are![AN]
Unfortunately, even if you speak true,[N]
it is the solemn duty of T.O.R.C.H.[N]
to hunt down every last lawbreaker.[AN]
[MR]
Really? But you're going to waste time[N]
hunting us when there are [OQ]lawbreakers[CQ][N]
all over, right outside these walls?[AN]
Ones who want to hurt or kill the people[N]
here? Captain Lua's crew is much less-[AN]
[ML]
Harmful? Do you really believe that?[N]
Certainly, the Redwings deserve[N]
eradication; I won't dispute that.[AN]
But in contrast, your gang of pirates[N]
have acquired the Fire Emblem, correct?[AN]
[MR]
H-How do you know about that?[AN]
[ML]
The empire has eyes everywhere, boy.[AN]
[Beat]In any case, those who possess the[N]
Fire Emblem pose a far greater danger[N]
than common brigands. That is clear.[AN]
[MR]
[Beat] [Beat][A]
[ML]
Now, you asked that I let you go?[N]
Certainly. But if you do leave,[N]
then my soldiers will follow suit.[AN]
And the Redwings may notice that[N]
and take advantage of the situation[Beat][N]
You wouldn't want that, would you?[AN]
[Beat]Go along, then. Inform your crew.[A]
[MR]
[Beat]Fine. I can't guarantee that they'll[N]
stay and fight, but I can promise this:[AN]
I will, even if I'm the only one left![A][X]

## HubD3BeginningScene4
[MidLeft][LoadEnrique]
[MidRight][LoadFidel][3LB]
Hey, Enrique! The hell are you doing?[N]
I told you that those bandits[N]
are getting closer, didn't I?[AN]
We need to cover those cracked walls[N]
to make sure that they don't get in.[AN]
[ML]
[Beat]There's been a change in plans,[N]
Fidel. The Skysabers have shown[N]
themselves, just as I expected.[AN]
My forces have more important[N]
matters to deal with than[N]
guarding the people here.[AN]
[MR]
Razvan's crew is here[Beat]?[N]
No, never mind that right now.[AN]
So what, you're going to leave[N]
protecting them all up to me?[N]
You're playing with people's lives![AN]
[ML]
The people in the outskirts know[N]
the price of living in a squalid,[N]
remote area like this desert.[AN]
They put their own lives at risk[Beat][N]
So they can't blame us for what[N]
happens next. Now, I'd best be off.[AN]
Do what your heart wills, Fidel;[N]
I have my own duty to uphold.[AN]
[MR]
You son of a bitch! What kind[N]
of duty orders you to sacrifice[N]
innocent lives? [Beat]You know what?[AN]
Fine. But today's the last day[N]
that I work with you, Enrique.[N]
I hope you fall to the Lands Below![A][X]

## HubD3BeginningScene5
[MidLeft][LoadEnrique][3LB]
A shame[Beat] But it matters not.[AN]
Today, men, we will become heroes[N]
of the empire! When the Skysabers[N]
return, capture them dead or alive![A][X]

[FR][3LB]
[Beat]A report, Lua. The bandits[N]
are on the move, as we speak.[N]
They mean to attack all sides.[AN]
[FL]
Damn[Beat] And that T.O.R.C.H. boss[N]
isn't doin' a thing to stop it?[N]
He's got his soldiers right on us![AN]
[L]
It's just as you said, Razvan.[N]
Even if we turned around and ran,[N]
he'd chase us without a doubt.[AN]
[Beat]So? What do you want to do?[AN]
[R]
I[Beat] I know that this is selfish,[N]
but please, help me save my hometown![N]
Help me save my mother's life![AN]
[FL]
Heh[Beat] Relax, Raz. I ain't goin'[N]
anywhere, not when a friend's in need.[N]
'Sides, I've wanted to bust some heads![AN]
[FR]
We can't escape safely with T.O.R.C.H.[N]
chasing us, anyway. We'll need to cut[N]
off the serpent's head. Right, Lua?[AN]
[L]
Yep. We should send a couple parties along[N]
the sides to intercept the bandits, too,[N]
or we might not make it there in time.[AN]
If we're going to do this, we'll do it[N]
right. Let's save everyone that we can[N]
and[Beat] charge them for the trouble, later.[A]
[R][ToggleSmile]
[Beat]Always out for money, aren't you?[N]
Really, thanks so much, everyone[Beat][AN]
You're risking your lives for my sake,[N]
so I'll do all that I can to make sure[N]
that your kindness doesn't go to waste![AN][X]

## HubD3PostPrepsScene1
[MidLeft][LoadInka][3LB]
[Beat]Huh, T.O.R.C.H. really isn't moving.[N]
Alright, boys! Get the prisoners[N]
to finish breaking down those walls![AN]
[Beat]Gotta say, I never thought that[N]
I'd be the last of the old guard,[N]
or the one to see our dream come true.[AN]
We all thought that we'd die out[N]
in those sands, with nothing,[N]
just like what we were born with[Beat][AN]
But now, we're about to get ourselves[N]
a home of our own, along with revenge[N]
on the people who threw us out as babes![AN]
Heh[Beat] Heheheh! Alright, boys, start[N]
smiling! This here's your forever home![A][X]

## HubD3PostPrepsScene2
[MidRight][LoadFidel]
[MR][3LB]
Good, everyone's evacuated to the[N]
town center[Beat] This'll make it[N]
easier to keep them all safe,[AN]
though it means their homes[N]
won't have any protection[Beat][AN]
[MidLeft][LoadCorina]
[ML]
S-Sir, are you sure that[N]
you must stay outside?[N]
It isn't safe here-[AN]
[MR]
That's why I must, miss.[N]
My men have the weaker parts[N]
of the walls all covered,[AN]
but if the Redwings break[N]
through, somebody's gotta[N]
guard the town center, right?[AN]
[ML]
But[Beat] Can you really handle it?[N]
Those bandits are vicious[Beat][N]
They've taken many lives-[A]
[MR]
Hey, now! I may act like this,[N]
but I really am a talented mage,[N]
you know? Have some faith in me.[AN]
At the very least, I'll hold out[N]
long enough for our [OQ]saviors[CQ][N]
to arrive[Beat] So get inside, please.[AN]
[ML]
[Beat]If you say so, then I will, Fidel.[N]
Thank you so much for protecting us.[N]
Please, stay safe. For Razvan's sake.[AN][CSSCF]
[MR]
Heh[Beat] It may be your boy that saves[N]
us all, Corina. Raz[Beat] Sure has been[N]
a while, huh? I'm counting on you![A][X]

going to let the people here die?![A][X]

[MidLeft][LoadEnrique][3LB]

anything. That is my charge![A][X]

[MidLeft][LoadInka][3LB]
Heh[Beat] Never thought it'd be this easy.[N]
Almost a letdown, in a way[Beat] But hey,[N]
I'll take a free win where I can get it.[AN][X]

## HubD3MidBattle_Inka_ReinforcementResponse
[MidLeft][LoadInka][3LB]
Oh, you guys finally showed up[Beat][N]
Fly in and break the inner walls![AN]
Everybody else, try to tear through[N]
the guards and raid any house you can![AN]
And lastly[Beat] Good job taking down those[N]
walls, prisoners. Now, stay where you[N]
are[Beat] You'll make for good fodder![A][X]

[MR][LoadRazvan][3LB]
No one's running around in a panic[Beat][N]
They must have all made for the town[N]
hall up on the hill. Captain, a word?[AN]
[ML]
Sure. Hit me, Razvan.[A]
[MR]
Don't bother visiting the homes[N]
close to the center of the town;[N]
everyone's holed up in the town hall.[AN]
As long as we can protect that,[N]
then everyone should be safe![AN]
[ML]
Sounds like a plan. Those lizard-brains[N]
look like they've got a mind to burn[N]
down some of their homes, though[Beat][AN]
[MR]
Yes[Beat] If we can, I'd like to try[N]
to protect the village, too. I'm sure[N]
that everyone would appreciate it.[AN]
[ML]
Heh[Beat] Well, if they want to show[N]
their appreciation in doubloons,[N]
then I won't have any complaints![A][X]

## D3LuaNoticesEvacuationText
[MidLeft][LoadLua][3LB]
Hm[Beat] Now that I look a little closer,[N]
there's nobody around the houses.[N]
Seems they're boarded up, too[Beat][AN]
Everyone must've ran for the town hall[N]
up there on the hill to take cover.[N]
No sense in checking on the homes, then.[AN]
We just need to make sure that those[N]
lizard-brains don't make it to the hill,[N]
and the rest of the job'll be easy![A][X]

At this rate, the civilians will die[N]

up this matter with the Skysabers.[AN]
That way, we may be able to save[N]
at least a few of the people here[Beat][N]
As little penance as that may be.[AN]

That is, if you're truly as[N]

Heh. Quite a strange view of[N]

reach the others in my crew.[AN]
[Beat]Perhaps all I needed[N]
was a place to belong.[A][CSSCF]
[ML][LoadEnrique]
Enough of this fantasy![AN]
You're a member of T.O.R.C.H.,[N]
hated by pirates of all kinds.[AN]
Do you think that your precious[N]
crew forgot that fact?[AN]
One day, you'll wake up[N]
with a knife in your chest![AN][CSSCF]
[MR][LoadAvocado]
No[Beat] I am T.O.R.C.H. no longer.[N]
And were that to be my fate,[AN]
so be it. Better that than[N]
the life I led before it![AN]

[Beat]Hm. An old woman?[AN]
What brings you to[N]
this battlefield?[AN][CSSCF]
[MR][LoadPilar]
What else?[N]
I'm a pirate.[A][CSSCF]
[ML][LoadEnrique]
[Beat]Then I suppose I have[N]
no choice here, do I?[AN][CSSCF]
[MR][LoadPilar]
You always have a choice.[N]
But for a man like you,[AN]
blinded by his position,[N]
you can't even see it.[AN]
That's how all enforcers[N]
of the empire truly are.[AN][CSSCF]
[ML][LoadEnrique]
[Beat]Ah, hold a moment![N]
You[Beat] I remember you![AN]
It's been fifty years,[N]
and yet[Beat] I remember![AN]
You're the mad woman who[N]
assaulted an imperial base,[AN]
deep in the empire's heart[Beat][A][CSSCF]
[MR][LoadPilar][ToggleSmile]
[Beat]Ah, my final gift before[N]
I sailed to the Old World?[AN]
I'd almost forgotten.[AN][CSSCF][ToggleSmile]
[ML][LoadEnrique]
Gift? You call that a gift?![AN]
You killed a hundred men in[N]
the span of ten minutes![AN]
I[Beat] I was the only survivor[N]
of the Grey Ghost. Of you![A][CSSCF]
[MR][LoadPilar]
That's the name you all chose?[N]
Well, it doesn't really matter.[AN]
Yes, I was much wilder in my[N]
youth. So much to prove[Beat][AN]
When I heard about a summit[N]
for rising Incendivis leaders,[AN]
I saw an opportunity to cripple[N]
Incendivis. For a time, at least.[AN]
[Beat]But in the end, it changed[N]
little. Such is life, I suppose.[AN][CSSCF]
[ML][LoadEnrique]
That's all you have to say?[AN]
You[Beat] You demon![N]
I'll avenge them all![AN][CSSCF]
[MR][LoadPilar]
[Beat]Try all you like,[N]
dog of the empire.[AN]
But, today, I swear[Beat][N]
I'll finish the job![A][X]

## D3_Enrique_Jaime_BQ
[ML][LoadEnrique]
Hm? Agh, how irritating[Beat][AN]
You mean to sit in the sky[N]
instead of fight with honor?[AN][CSSCF]
[MR][LoadJaime]
Honor isn't worth a damn,[N]
so yeah, I'll stay up here.[AN]
So, gramps[Beat] You're the[N]
boss of T.O.R.C.H., here?[AN][CSSCF]
[ML][LoadEnrique]
That I am. Second only[N]
to Elodia. Have you met?[AN]
Hold on[Beat] You're the scion[N]
of del Rias, aren't you?[AN]
The runaway rebel noble?[AN][CSSCF]
[MR][LoadJaime]
[Beat]The one and only.[AN]
I saw just how shitty[N]
Incendivis is, firsthand[Beat][AN]
I saw how easy a life I had,[AN]
because my dad could grease[N]
the right palms with gold.[AN]
Made me sick to my stomach[Beat][AN]
And so, I left home with[N]
a pegasus, and that's it.[AN]
But damn, I almost doubted[N]
myself when Elodia showed up.[AN][CSSCF]
[ML][LoadEnrique]
She has that way about her[Beat][AN]
Regardless, you must return[N]
home at once, Hector del Rias.[AN]
I am willing to overlook your[N]
transgressions, of course.[AN][CSSCF]
[MR][LoadJaime]
[Beat]See, that's why I left.[AN][CSSCF]
[ML][LoadEnrique]
You don't understand, child.[AN]
It is necessary for those[N]
born into power to keep it,[AN]
for the stability of the[N]
empire. That is their charge-[AN][CSSCF]
[MR][LoadJaime]
Ridiculous! Being born into[N]
power doesn't mean a thing.[AN]
It says nothing about who[N]
I am and if I'm worthy of it.[AN]
The people who have power[N]
should be those who earn it![AN]
Isn't that how you made it[N]
to where you are now?[AN][CSSCF]
[ML][LoadEnrique]
Of course, but comparing me[N]
to a noble family is just-[AN][CSSCF]
[MR][LoadJaime]
It's the way it should be![AN]
Here with the Skysabers,[N]
my name means nothing[Beat][AN]
And I couldn't be happier![AN]
Everything that I've got now,[N]
I earned with my own hands.[AN]
This is the life for me![AN]
So, if the captain wants[N]
you gone[Beat] You're gone![A][X]

## D3_Enrique_Desiderio_BQ
[MR][LoadDesiderio][ToggleSmile]
So, you're the head honcho?[N]
Heh, you don't look so tough![AN]
If you're the boss here,[N]
then there's no way I'd lose![AN][CSSCF]
[ML][LoadEnrique]
Oh? What gives a bilge-rat[N]
the right to denigrate me?[AN][CSSCF]
[MR][LoadDesiderio]
Way I see it, one of us is[N]
puttin' good people at risk.[AN]
And that ain't me, is it?[AN][CSSCF]
[ML][LoadEnrique]
No, it is you. You and your[N]
crew greedily grasp at power,[AN]
holding onto the Fire Emblem[N]
despite the risks entailed.[AN]
That forced my hand[Beat][N]
Leading us to this moment.[AN][CSSCF]
[MR][LoadDesiderio]
Well, ain't that convenient?[N]
Pass off all the blame to us,[AN]
when you're the one turnin'[N]
his back to the Redwings.[AN]
But let's play your game.[AN]
You say that us havin' this[N]
Fire Emblem is dangerous?[AN]
Maybe. But it'd be a hell[N]
of a lot worse if you did.[AN]
You want it bad enough to[N]
sit on your damn thumbs,[AN]
watchin' innocents die![AN]
You ask me? You're the[N]
greedy bastard, here![A][CSSCF]
[ML][LoadEnrique]
Greedy[Beat] Me?[N]
Ha[Beat] Hahahaha![AN]
A pirate saying that[Beat][N]
Hahahaha! Ahahahaha![A][CSSCF]
[MR][LoadDesiderio]
[Beat]Laugh it up, buddy.[N]
I know who I am. What I am.[AN]
That's why I've got a clear[N]
eye and a clear heart.[AN]
And what my heart's tellin'[N]
me[Beat] is to kick your ass![A][X]

## D3_Enrique_BQ
[ML][LoadEnrique]
[Beat]You've taken quite some[N]
time to reach me, Skysabers.[AN]
I was beginning to wonder[N]
if you planned to retreat[Beat][AN]
But it seems you're made of[N]
stronger stuff than that.[AN]
You'd have to be, to make[N]
it as far as you have, hm?[AN]
[Beat]No matter. My duty is clear:[AN]
take you all into custody,[N]
and retrieve the Fire Emblem![AN]
For that, I will sacrifice[N]
anyone, even myself![A][X]

Yeah, I'm here to kill you,[AN]
just like all your dogs have[N]
been slaughtering my boys.[AN][CSSCF]
[ML][LoadFidel]
You say it like we're the[N]
same, but you know, lady[Beat][AN]
There's one real big[N]
difference between us.[AN]
My troops did all they could[N]
to save people, not kill them.[AN][CSSCF]
[MR][LoadInka]
Look, I'm not interested[N]
in the moralizing, pal.[AN]
All I care about is that you[N]

[ML][LoadFidel]

[Beat]You're the leader, aren't[N]
you? Inka of the Redwings?[AN][CSSCF]
[ML][LoadInka]
Oh? You know my name?[AN][CSSCF]
[MR][LoadRazvan]
Of course I do! Every person[N]
who lives here knows it.[AN]
It's the name of the woman[N]
who torments us without end![AN][CSSCF]
[ML][LoadInka]
Oh, that right? Hearing that[N]
brings a warmth to my heart[Beat][AN]
It's great to know that our[N]
hate for you all is mutual![AN][CSSCF]
[MR][LoadRazvan]
Mutual? What did any of us[N]
ever do to you to earn that?[AN]
You're the ones who've raided[N]
homes in the dead of night[Beat][AN]
You're the ones who snatch[N]
children playing by the walls,[AN]
demanding an exorbitant[N]
ransom to return them![AN][CSSCF]
[ML][LoadInka]
Heh[Beat] And so what if we did?[AN]
Me and the guys, we didn't[N]
come out of nowhere, kid.[AN]
Some of us were orphans[N]
abandoned in the sands[Beat][AN]
Some of us were outlaws[N]
who could go nowhere else[Beat][AN]
But no matter our stories,[N]
we were cast out by society.[AN]
That's why it's [OQ]mutual[CQ].[AN]
People like you are the ones[N]
who put us in this position.[A][CSSCF]
[MR][LoadRazvan]
[Beat]Is that how you justify[N]
each sin that you commit?[AN][CSSCF]
[ML][LoadInka]
Heh[Beat] Couldn't care less[N]
about my sins, you brat.[AN]
Me and my gang were dealt[N]
a bad hand, so we played it.[AN][CSSCF]
[MR][LoadRazvan]
[Beat]It's true that you can't[N]
control the hand you're dealt.[AN]
Mine had its own issues, but[N]
it sounds better than yours.[AN][CSSCF]
[ML][LoadInka]
That's right! You were a lucky[N]
little shit, so shut up and-[AN][CSSCF]

But during my journeys, I've[N]
met many as bad off as you.[AN]
Some of them have fallen[N]
to banditry, that's true[Beat][AN]
But just as many have fought[N]
to better their lives![AN][CSSCF]
[ML][LoadInka]
Bah! And where did that get-[A][CSSCF]
[MR][LoadRazvan]
Further than you'll ever go![AN]
Someone like you, who never[N]
tried to live an honest life[Beat][AN]
Someone who stepped on anyone[N]
and everyone in their way,[AN]
driven by nothing but spite[Beat][AN]
You could never be anything[N]

If my words unsettle you so,[N]

Oh, you want to just get[N]

Steady pay, easy work,[N]

No, no, I definitely[N]

Ah, that's right![AN]
I saw you with Kiril once,[N]
while I was scouting around.[AN][CSSCF]
[MR][LoadDmitr]
You[Beat] know my cousin?[AN][CSSCF]

Know him? I was his savior![AN]
Him and his boys would've[N]
died if it wasn't for me.[AN][CSSCF]
[MR][LoadDmitr]
What do you mean by that?[AN][CSSCF]
[ML][LoadInka]
There was one small problem[N]
with your cousin's escape[Beat][AN]
Living out in the sands means[N]
you've got no food or drink.[AN]
And hanging out where he was,[N]
there wasn't enough to steal.[AN]
So[Beat] I provided him a service.[AN]
My Redwings carried goods[N]
to the Antlions' little hideout.[AN][CSSCF]
[MR][LoadDmitr]
[Beat]For a steep price, I imagine.[AN]
Is that why my cousin grew so[N]
desperate? Because of you?[AN][CSSCF]

Heh[Beat] Him and plenty other[N]
third-rate thieves, yeah.[AN]
Get 'em reliant on you,[N]
charge 'em with interest,[AN]

Ha[Beat] I almost pity him.[AN][CSSCF]

[Beat]Trouble was, where to go?[N]
There's nowhere left for me, anymore.[N]
So for now, I'll keep playing pirate.[AN]
Considering our crew's circumstances,[N]
it seems the best way for me to find[N]
some sort of penance, for all this.[AN]
[MR]
Penance? What do you mean?[AN]
[ML]
[Beat]While I was alone, I considered[N]
something. Who should I blame?[N]
Who should I hate, for all this?[AN]
The Redwings? Yes, but they're just[N]
a symptom of a societal infection.[AN]
To eradicate them and those like them,[N]
it isn't enough just to wipe them out.[N]
A new order must establish itself.[AN]
[MR]
[Beat]A new order?[A]
[ML]
Yes. Incendivis has grown weak and[N]
corrupt; I cannot dispute that.[N]
But still, order is necessary.[AN]
[Beat]Without it, the Redwings and[N]
pirates like ourselves can stomp[N]
all over people without hesitation.[AN]
[MR]
So you want to put the Skysabers[N]
out of business[Beat] Is that it?[N]
You've gotten pretty bold, Razvan.[AN]
[ML]
Ha[Beat] I suppose that I have, captain.[AN]
It's true that we're more ethical[N]
than most other pirate crews[Beat][N]
But only your good nature sustains that.[AN]
You could have a change of heart at[N]
any time, and then, this crew would[N]
become just like the Redwings.[AN]
You could crush the weak at any time.[N]
[Beat]A just world wouldn't allow that[N]
to be the case. So, change is needed.[AN]
[MR]
[Beat]And how do you plan to make this[N]
change happen? It's hardly a small[N]
thing, rebuilding society itself.[AN]
[ML]
That part is something I'm working out,[N]
but for now, I'll bide my time and[N]
eliminate those who deserve it[Beat][AN]
Like the Redwings, for instance.[N]
We tend to run into those kinds[N]
of people a lot, don't we?[AN]
[Beat]Which is why I'm sticking around.[N]
Well, besides having grown fond[N]
of the crew, piracy aside.[AN]
[MR]
O-Oh[Beat] Well, whatever works.[N]
You've always got a place with us,[N]
Razvan. No matter what happens.[AN]
[ML]
Is that so? Glad to hear it.[N]
Anyway, we'd better go gather[N]
the bodies and start digging.[AN]
Mom and everyone else[Beat][N]
They at least deserve that much.[AN]
[MR]
[Beat]Right. Let's go, Razvan.[A][X]
