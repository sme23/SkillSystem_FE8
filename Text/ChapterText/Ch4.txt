## Ch4BeginningScene1
[MidLeft][LoadPilar]
[MidRight][LoadLua]
[MidRight]
Ah, Pilar. You're back?[N]
[Beat]Have you thought it over?[AN]
[MidLeft]
[Beat]Thought over staying with the crew[N]
and helping you steal the Fire Emblem?[AN]
Yes, I have. It's all I've thought about.[AN]
[MidRight]
I get that it's a big decision, really.[AN]
The Keepers[Beat] You spent more time with[N]
them than us,[A] so if you're not comfortable[N]
helping us take the Fire Emblem from them,[AN]
then I won't involve you in this, Pilar.[AN]
[MidLeft]
Really? You would trust me not to pass[N]
on this news to Quispe and sell you out?[AN]
[MidRight]
Of course. No matter what you choose,[N]
you're still a member of the crew.[AN]
I'd trust you not to get any of us[N]
killed, if you could avoid it.[AN]
[MidLeft]
[Beat]A captain shouldn't let their emotions[N]
interfere with the right choice, Lua.[AN]
You think you know me and my loyalties,[N]
but people are often more than they seem.[AN]
[MidRight]
In all that talk, I don't hear your[N]
answer. Are you with us, or not?[AN]
[MidLeft][3LB]
[Beat]Yes, I am. The Keepers I knew[N]
were Wayra's, the man I loved.[AN]
The whispers around Quispe[Beat][N]
As much as I wish they were false,[N]
I know that child better than that.[AN]
If they thought it necessary,[N]
they would do anything[Beat][N]
And if they would betray Wayra,[AN]
then my decision is clear.[N]
The Fire Emblem will be safer[N]
in our hands[Beat] In yours, Lua.[AN]
[MidRight]
Heh, you had me worried for a bit,[N]
but I'm thankful you're sticking around.[N]
We can't replace you, Pilar. Not ever.[AN]
[MidLeft]
[Beat]Hmph. In any case, their temple guard[N]
is thin. Give me a few days to observe,[N]
and I'll find a route for infiltration.[AN]
[MidRight][2LB]
You got it. It's up to you,[N]
Pilar[Beat] We're counting on you.[A][X]

## Ch4ThreeDaysLater
Three days later...[A][X]

## Ch4BeginningScene2
[MidLeft][LoadLua]
[Right][LoadRazvan]
[FarRight][LoadDesiderio]
[MidLeft]
[Beat]There goes Pilar. Any bets on how[N]
long it'll take to knock out the guards?[AN]
[Right]
I'm not one to gamble,[N]
but five minutes, at most.[AN]
Miss Pilar has never let us down before,[N]
and I wouldn't expect her to start now.[AN]
[FarRight]
[Beat]You sure she'll follow through, boss?[N]
Not saying she'd backstab us, but-[AN]
[MidLeft]
I trust every member of this crew,[N]
Desiderio. And Pilar above most.[AN]
Former Keeper or no, she's proven[N]
that she's one of us at every turn.[AN]
If that's not enough for you-[AN]
[FarRight]
Nah, that's enough, boss.[AN]
If you wanna trust in her still,[N]
then I'll believe in that trust.[AN]
Captain's word is law, after all.[AN]
[MidLeft]
Heh[Beat] You got that right.[N]
Now, let's keep an eye out-[AN]
[Right]
C-Captain, I see something![N]
Someone's coming this way![A][X]

## Ch4BeginningScene3
[MidLeft][LoadPilar]
[MidRight][LoadLua]
[MidLeft]
The guards are handled, Lua.[N]
Ready to infiltrate?[AN]
[MidRight]
More than ready. Every trial that[N]
we've faced has led up to this[Beat][AN]
Let's make it all worth it, Skysabers![N]
Get in there and grab the Fire Emblem![A][X]

## Ch4BeginningScene4_1
[FarLeft][LoadPilar]
[Left][LoadRazvan]
[Right][LoadLua]
[FarRight][LoadDesiderio]
[Right]
A chest at the very back of a temple,[N]
surrounded by[Beat] dragons, or something?[AN]
I'd bet every last doubloon that this[N]
thing's got what we're looking for.[AN]
[Left]
Er[Beat] Wouldn't they hide the Fire Emblem[N]
a bit better, if it's so important?[AN]
This seems like a trap, Captain Lua.[AN]
[FarLeft]
I already inspected the chest, Razvan.[N]
There's no trap: that much is certain.[AN]
[FarRight]
Then let's pop the damn thing open,[N]
already! The waiting's killing me.[AN]
[Right]
[Beat]Time to see what's inside.[N]
Orlando[Beat] This better be worth it.[A][X]

## Ch4BeginningScene4_2
[FarLeft][LoadPilar]
[Left][LoadRazvan]
[Right][LoadLua]
[FarRight][LoadDesiderio]
[Right]
This[Beat] isn't what I was expecting.[N]
It has the holster of a musket, but[Beat][AN]
It's attached to a blade?[N]
Seems like an impractical weapon.[AN]
[FarLeft]
Perhaps it was ceremonial in use?[N]
It certainly looks ancient.[AN]
As it were crafted millenia ago[Beat][N]
Lua, how does it feel?[AN]
[Right]
[Beat]The moment I lifted it out of the[N]
chest, I felt something hard to describe.[AN]
That gem in the gunblade's hilt[Beat][N]
Can you sense anything, Razvan?[AN]
[Left]
You can't, captain? The arcane power[N]
flowing from it[Beat] It beggars belief.[AN]
From you, to the gem, then back again[Beat][N]
Were you a mage, you'd sense it, too.[AN]
[FarRight]
Hey, mind if I give it a spin, boss?[N]
Not that I'm one for swords,[AN]
but I wanna see if I can feel[N]
that power Razvan's talkin' about.[AN]
[Right]
Knock yourself out, Desiderio.[N]
Just don't drop it, got it?[AN]
[FarRight]
C'mon, what do you take me for-[N]
Shit, this thing's heavy as hell![AN]
I swear, it ain't my fault that[N]
I dropped it, boss. Honest![AN]
[Right]
Huh? Seriously? Felt normal to me.[N]
When'd you get so weak, huh?[AN]
[FarRight]
I'm tellin' ya, it's-[AN]
[FarLeft]
I've heard tell of weapons like this[N]
before. They bond to their users,[AN]
becoming unusable by anyone else.[N]
Perhaps, when you touched it[Beat][AN]
[Right]
It thinks I'm its master, now?[N]
Hell of an expectation[Beat][AN]
Well, we can get to the bottom[N]
of this later. For now, let's-[AN]
[FarFarRight]
Congratulations on seizing the[N]
Fire Emblem, Skysabers.[AN]
But did you think that you[N]
could escape my grasp so easily?[A][X]

## Ch4BeginningScene5
[MidLeft][LoadQuispe]
[Right][LoadLua]
[FarRight][LoadPilar]
[Right]
Quispe?! Pilar, didn't you handle[N]
the guys out front? What happened?[AN]
[FarRight]
I[Beat] Quispe, you knew?[AN]
[MidLeft]
Know? Pilar, anyone could guess that[N]
pirates would try to rob us blind,[AN]
on the way out. All I had to do was[N]
watch and wait for you to strike.[A]
[FarRight]
[Beat]And you managed to hide your presence,[AN]
as you watched? I suppose you learned[N]
something from your lessons, after all.[AN]
[Beat]Why, Quispe? Why did you murder Wayra?[AN]
[MidLeft]
W-What? I did no such thing![N]
I[Beat] Pilar, I would never![AN]
[FarRight]
But you were there when he died,[AN]
weren't you? Do you expect me[N]
to believe you bear no fault?[AN]
[MidLeft]
[Beat]You want to know the truth?[N]
Fine. No, I didn't kill him.[AN]
I[Beat] Before he passed away,[N]
we argued about the future.[AN]
Of the Keepers, and of all who would[N]
oppose Incendivis's grip on the skies.[AN]
There was[Beat] a solution that we both[N]
knew. But he refused to consider it,[AN]
no matter how much I pleaded with him.[AN]
[Beat]And in his anger, his age caught[N]
up with him. His heart, gave out.[AN]
[Beat]A thought occurred to me, then.[N]
"Perhaps it's better this way."[AN]
[FarRight]
You[Beat] You let him die, then.[N]
To seize control of the Keepers?[AN]
[MidLeft]
[Beat]This is about so much more, Pilar.[N]
More than you could ever imagine.[A][X]



## Ch4BeginningScene6
[MidLeft][LoadQuispe]
[Right][LoadLua]
W-What's that shaking?[N]
Did you cause this?![AN]
[MidLeft]
Ha[Beat] Hahaha! No, you did![AN]
I have to admit, I never[N]
expected it to start so soon.[AN]
[Right]
What's going on, Quispe?[N]
Answer me[Beat] Now![AN]
[MidLeft][3LB]
Why should I do that? I have you[N]
surrounded, and soon, I'll kill you[N]
and reclaim your newfound prize.[AN]
[Beat]But if you want the Fire Emblem[N]
so badly, then by all means, Lua.[AN]
Fight for it. Fight *with* it.[N]
Show me that you have what it takes[N]
to wield it, and I'll have no complaint.[AN]
[Right]
Damn it[Beat][N]
Fine, you're on![N]
Skysabers, into position.[AN]
[MidLeft][CloseSpeechSlow][ClearFace]
[FarRight][LoadRazvan]
I-Is there really no other way out,[N]
captain? Surely we can try to talk[N]
to some of them and convince them-[A][CloseSpeechSlow][ClearFace]
[FarRight][LoadPilar]
Trust me: not one of Quispe's retinue[N]
would listen to our pleas. Our only[N]
way out[Beat] is through them, now.[A][CloseSpeechSlow][ClearFace]
[FarRight][LoadDesiderio]
Heh, I've been waitin' for this![N]
Enough fetchin' the Keepers' bones:[N]
let's show 'em that we ain't their dogs![A][CloseSpeechSlow][ClearFace]
[Right]
Well said. Leave no chest unturned[N]
on our way out, either! Let's take[N]
these Keepers for all they're worth![A][X]

[FarLeft][LoadPilar]
[Left][LoadRazvan]
[Right][LoadLua]
[FarRight][LoadDesiderio]
[Right]
Alright, we've broken through![N]
[Beat]Wait, this feeling[Beat][AN]
[Left]
The entire island is quaking, captain![N]
What[Beat] What have we done, Miss Pilar?[AN]
[FarLeft]
[Beat]I can't tell you any more than what[N]
we know: the Fire Emblem is to blame.[AN]
Quispe knew the consequences.[N]
[Beat]Did Wayra, too? Is that why-[AN]
[FarRight][3LB]
We don't have time to think it over,[N]
Pilar. That Quispe guy's still around,[N]
and they were headed back to the village.[AN]
They'll have the whole damn place[N]
up in arms within the hour, I'd bet.[AN]
[Right]
And none of them will believe that Quispe[N]
knew and planned for us to do this[Beat][N]
Though not for their defeat, it seems.[AN]
Desiderio's right. If we want to escape,[N]
then we can't waste time speculating.[AN]
[Beat]It'll be a packed ride, given the[N]
ship's not quite as big as I wanted,[N]
but we'll have to make do, won't we?[AN]
Time to set off. Follow me, everyone![AN][CloseSpeechSlow][ClearFace]
[FarRight][ToggleSmile]
Finally! Been tired of the place since[N]
we landed. But hey, at least we're free,[AN]
now. Free of the demands and wishlists[N]
of the sanctimonious asses living here.[N]
[Beat]Nobody's our boss, but us. Got that?[AN][CloseSpeechSlow][ClearFace][ToggleSmile]
[Left]
The people here seemed so sure that[N]
separating themselves from Incendivis[N]
would lead to a brighter tomorrow.[AN]
But in the end, corruption can be found[N]
anywhere[Beat] This was a good reminder.[AN][CloseSpeechSlow][ClearFace]
[FarLeft]
[Beat]I would have liked to leave under[N]
better circumstances, but so be it.[AN]
Quispe[Beat] Wayra and I raised you as[N]
if you were our own grandchild.[N]
Why[Beat] Why would you do this?[A][X]

## Ch4EndingSceneTransition1
After Lua's crew escapes...[A][X]

## Ch4EndingScene2
[MidRight][LoadBoru]
[MidLeft][LoadQuispe]
So you're certain that the Skysabers[N]
have escaped, Boru? They've sailed away?[A]
[MidRight]
Y-Yes, Quispe. Apologies,[N]
but on such short notice-[AN]
[MidLeft]
Relax, I understand. They evaded me,[N]
after all, and a band of elites[Beat][AN]
I never expected to nail them down.[N]
Have you sent scouts after them?[AN]
[MidRight]
O-Of course! A group of dragon riders[N]
pursue them as we speak, chief.[AN]
[MidLeft]
Good. Order them to make no move[N]
and observe. When the time comes,[AN]
we'll chase them ourselves and reclaim[N]
the Fire Emblem. One way, or another[Beat][AN]
[MidRight]
Y-Yes, Quispe. As you command![A][CloseSpeechSlow][ClearFace]
[MidLeft]
Hm[Beat] I have to admit, I never imagined[N]
that they would overpower me so easily.[AN]
But either way, they accomplished my goal[N]
for me. The Fire Emblem is now free[Beat][AN]
And with it, this farce of a world[N]
will finally come to an end.[AN]
Wayra[Beat] I will guide our flock[N]
to heights that you could never imagine.[AN]
[FarFarRight][LoadBoru]
C-Chief Quispe, it's[Beat][N]
You have to see this![A]
[MidLeft][ToggleSmile]
And right on cue, it begins[Beat][N]
The beginning of a new era![A][X]

## Ch4EndingSceneTransition2
Meanwhile, many leagues away...[A][X]

## Ch4EndingScene3
[MidRight][LoadLua]
[Beat]Free and clear, at last.[N]
But free of what, really?[AN]
This[Beat] Fire Emblem, they call it[Beat][N]
It's powering this weapon, isn't it?[AN]
But what other secrets does it hide?[AN]
[MidLeft][LoadDesiderio]
B-Boss! You gotta see this, now![AN]
[MidRight]
Desiderio? What's the matter?[N]
You're not one for panic.[AN]
[MidLeft]
Look back at the rebel islands,[N]
and you'll see it ain't panic.[AN]
[MidRight]
Fine, fine[Beat] Wait, the island's[N]
still shaking? And what's more, it's-[AN]
[MidLeft]
Yeah, and now, look the other way.[AN]
There's a little piece of land[N]
right over there[Beat] Take a gander.[AN]
[MidRight]
[Beat]They're all falling. Slowly,[N]
but still[Beat] they're falling?[AN]
How[Beat] How is this possible?[N]
Could it be the Fire Emblem's fault?[AN]
[MidLeft]
Your guess's good as mine, boss.[N]
[Beat]But one thing's damn certain.[AN]
If this keeps up, everyone, everywhere,[N]
is gonna crash down in the Lands Below.[AN]
And when that does happen[Beat][AN]
[MidRight]
[Beat]It'll be a brand new world.[A][X]
