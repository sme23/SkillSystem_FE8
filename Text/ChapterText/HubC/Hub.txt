Looks like there are a few folks[N]
who might have work for us[Beat][AN]
Well, we'll need every bit of help[N]
that we can get if we're going to[N]
fly out of here any time soon,[AN]
and I've got no hope of strongarming[N]
them with Quispe and their guards[N]
watching our movements like hawks.[AN]
I'll see what the people have to[N]
say and deal with their problems,[N]
if they pay the right price.[A][X]

## HubCSayWhereToGo
[MidRight][LoadLua][3LB]
Hm[Beat] That's enough of the odd jobs.[N]
Any more, and I'll die of boredom.[N]
It's time for a bigger heist[Beat][AN]
Pilar should've gotten my message[N]
earlier. Tonight, I'll hear her[N]
final decision. To stay with us[Beat][AN]
Or to go back to her everyday life.[N]
[Beat]Damn, I'm all nervous now.[AN]
I'd better go back to my room[N]
and settle my nerves before then.[AN][X]

[Beat]The shaking's finally stopped.[N]
It seems we've landed, Lua.[AN]
And no worse for wear,[N]
thanks to this saferoom.[AN]
Storing our essential supplies[N]
here was a prudent decision.[AN]
[MR][3LB]
If it's safe enough for the crew,[N]
it's safe enough for our loot,[N]
right? Still, we got lucky.[AN]
Who'd have thought T.O.R.C.H.[N]
coming after us in Port Greagor[N]
would end up saving our hides?[AN]
[ML]
Hm[Beat] But if we had avoided them,[N]
then Alonso's thugs may not have[N]
forced us to take this risk.[AN]
[MR]
Well, you've got a point there.[AN]
I've got a bad feeling that he made[N]
it through that mess just fine,[N]
but we can deal with him later.[AN]
For now, let's check outside[N]
and see what's waiting for us.[N]
[Beat]Or more accurately, who.[A][X]

[FarRight][LoadPilar]
[Left][3LB]
Feels good to be back on steady[N]
land for a change, but damn,[N]
the ship's a complete mess.[AN]
Not sure that Rahel lass can[N]
magic up a fix for this heap.[AN]
[FarLeft]
We won't be flying any time soon,[N]
then. Miss Pilar, you said that[N]
people lived around here, right?[AN]
Do they have a ship that they could[N]
give to us so that we can leave?[A]
[FarRight]
[OQ]Could", sure. Anybody living this[N]
far from Incendivis has the means[N]
to fly. But [OQ]would" is different.[AN]
[Right]
Well, there's only way to find out.[N]
Which way do we go, Pilar?[N]
Let's ask them ourselves.[AN]
[FarFarLeft][2LB]
Any questions that you have[N]
can be directed to me, instead.[AN][X]

## HubCBeginningScene3
[MidLeft][LoadQuispe]
[Right][LoadLua]
[FarRight][LoadPilar]
[Right]
What the[Beat] Who are you?[N]
The leader of Pilar's old pals?[AN]
[MidLeft][3LB]
If you need a name, we are Keepers[N]
of a forgotten age with no masters,[N]
one Incendivis would like you to forget.[AN]
I suppose I represent our group[N]
more often than not in these matters,[N]
especially when pirates are involved,[AN]
but I do not consider myself or anyone[N]
a leader in the sense that you use it.[N]
We all rule ourselves and no one else.[AN]
[Beat]Pilar, I see you have returned.[N]
What information do you have for me?[AN]
[FR]
[Beat]Too much to share now, Quispe.[AN]
But for the time being, do you mind[N]
hearing out Lua's requests for aid?[AN]
She's helped me a great deal in my[N]
travels, and I'd see it repaid.[AN]
[R]
Wait, hold on a second here.[N]
You work for this[Beat] Quispe?[N]
What kind of name is that?[AN]
[ML]
In my tongue, a perfectly fine one,[N]
but I wouldn't expect those as ignorant[N]
as you pirates to comprehend this.[AN]
[Beat]Pilar understands my, and my flock's,[N]
vision. Our ideals and hopes align.[AN]
Those being toppling Incendivis,[N]
no matter how difficult the task.[AN]
[R]
The hell? You're a rebel, Pilar?[N]
I knew you had a bone to pick[N]
with the empire, but most pirates do.[AN]
[FR]
[Beat]I wasn't exactly subtle, was I?[AN]
My hatred for Incendivis runs deep,[N]
which caused me to leave it behind[N]
years ago and drift into the Old World.[AN]
There, I found this community[N]
of outsiders similar to me.[AN]
A man named Wayra gathered us here[N]
and made us into something more.[AN]
Ever since, I've journeyed outside[N]
the storms to gather information[N]
that we could use to strike back,[AN]
against the empire and its enforcers.[AN]
[R]
You[Beat] So you were just using us to[N]
get by until you could get back here?[AN]
[FR]
[Beat]No, I truly enjoyed my time[N]
with the crew. That's why[Beat][AN]
Let me help you get back on your[N]
feet and on your way, Lua.[N]
This is no place for you.[AN]
[ML]
If that is your wish, Pilar,[N]
then so be it. Captain Lua,[N]
was it?[A] I have no love for pirates,[N]
but if you require some assistance,[N]
my flock may be able to help you.[AN]
Whether it be furnishing materials[N]
or manpower to repair your ship,[AN]
or supplying you with provisions[N]
to replace those you have lost,[N]
we have many resources to provide.[AN]
However, my flock has no obligation[N]
to you, and they may request that[N]
you provide them with aid in return.[AN]
Some pirates have ignored my warnings[N]
and tried to steal from our community,[N]
but I wouldn't recommend that path.[AN]
That is, if you wish to keep your lives.[AN]
[R]
[Beat]Yeah, like I want to tangle with[N]
you and your wyvern. No thanks, Quispe.[AN]
Tell you what: I'll ask around later[N]
and see who's willing to part[N]
with what we need, and at what cost.[AN]
[FR]
Good. I know the people here well,[N]
so I can guide you around here, Lua.[AN]
For now, though, I have business[N]
to take care of with Quispe.[AN]
You all can stay in any of the empty[N]
lodges in the village up that path.[AN]
Come find me when you're ready,[N]
and I'll help you with any[N]
requests the people give you.[A][X]

Hmph[Beat] I could tell she had a soft[N]
side for rebels, but I hoped that[N]
it was somethin' she did a while ago.[AN]
But this whole time, she was spyin'[N]
for them[Beat] Who knows what she'll[N]
tell those rats about us, boss?[AN]
You sure you wanna let her walk away?[AN]
[MR]
Her allegiance is her business.[N]
[Beat]I'm the one in the wrong,[N]
trusting her despite the signs.[AN]
[FL]
Trusting people isn't wrong, Captain Lua.[AN]
Not ever. I know Miss Pilar isn't who[N]
we thought she was, but even still,[N]
I'm sure she means well for us.[AN]
If she didn't, we never would've[N]
made it this far in the first place.[AN]
[L]
Yeah, you're right, Raz, but[Beat][AN]
I just[Beat] I just can't believe that[N]
once our business is through here,[N]
she's gonna leave us out to dry.[AN]
Like none of the shit we've been[N]
through together mattered[Beat][AN][CloseEyes]
I need to go cool my head, boss.[N][OpenEyes]
Call me if you need anything.[A][CSSCF]
[FL]
I[Beat] I have a hard time imagining[N]
our crew without Miss Pilar, also.[N]
Maybe we can change her mind, captain?[AN]
If she'd listen to anyone on this,[N]
she'd listen to you. I'm sure of it.[AN]
[MR]
[Beat]It's her choice to make, Razvan.[N]
I'm not going to bother convincing[N]
someone who doesn't want to be here.[AN]
She's done enough already, showing[N]
us a path out of this mess we're in.[N]
Let's get to walking it and move on.[A][CSSCF]
[FL]
Captain Lua[Beat] Even if you[N]
give up on her, I won't![A][X]

## HubCBeginningScene5
[MidLeft][LoadPilar]
[MidRight][LoadLua]
[MidLeft]
So, you're here. Good, good.[N]
Ready to go make the rounds?[AN]
[MR]
[Beat]Ready as I'll ever be, Pilar.[N]
Fill me in on the details.[AN]
What's with these requests[N]
that Quispe mentioned yesterday?[AN]
[ML][3LB]
They're no different from those[N]
you'd find in any other part[N]
of the world. People have problems,[AN]
and some of the problems have no[N]
recourse beyond brute force.[AN]
That's where a roving pirate crew[N]
comes in handy, doesn't it?[AN]
No connections to the community[N]
means no pain if they fail.[AN]
[MR]
In other words, we're hired guns[N]
that are just as good dead as we[N]
are alive, to these Keepers. Wonderful.[AN]
[ML][2LB]
As Quispe said, us Keepers have tangled[N]
with pirates before and suffered for it.[AN]
I'm more open-minded than the others,[N]
naturally. I've been one long enough.[AN]
[MR]
A fake one, but whatever you say.[N]
Let's get moving already, Pilar.[AN]
That way, you can get back to your[N]
perfect life here all the sooner.[A][CSSCF]
[ML][3LB]
[Beat]You couldn't be further from the truth,[N]
Lua. If Wayra still led the Keepers,[N]
perhaps, but Quispe[Beat] Who knows?[AN]
Since Wayra passed a few months back,[N]
things around here[Beat] They've changed.[AN]
Old age, they said? We'll see what[N]
I can discover while I'm here,[N]
and what the truth really is[Beat][A][X]

[ML]
[ToggleSmile]Missed me, Captain Lua?[N]
It's been a long time.[ToggleSmile][AN]
How's the noble brat[N]
you took off my hands?[A]
[MR]
Hermenegildo? He's made himself[N]
useful in the past few months.[AN]
Turns out he's a halfway[N]
decent swordsman, after all.[A]
[ML]
Now that's a surprise.[AN]
[Beat]But I didn't come here[N]
to banter about the past.[AN]
Lua, I[Beat] need your help.[A]
[MR][1LB]
What? Why?[A]
[ML][2LB]
My Rioja Reapers[Beat] [CloseEyes]picked[N]
a fight we couldn't win.[AN]
Now they're dead, and the force[N]
we were up against remains.[AN]
[OpenEyes]I need it stopped, and soon.[AN]

[MR]
I've never known you to[N]
make this little sense.[AN]
Before I help you with whatever[N]
it is you're planning,[AN]
I need to at least know[N]
the full story first.[A]
[ML]
[OpenEyes]Fine, then. I've nowhere[N]
else to turn to for a hand.[AN]
Do you know the[N]
name Count Sanz?[A]
[MR]
Some Imperial noble with[N]
a reputation as a hoarder.[AN]
My crew actually pulled a[N]
heist on him a while back.[A]
[ML]
His bodyguard, Yurena, is [ToggleSmile]far more[N]

She and I have been chasing each[N]

We found her and her[N]
wretched boss delving[N]

and the rest of Sanz's guards[N]
slew my crew to the last.[AN]
[CloseEyes]Lanzarote, my first mate,[N]
clung to life just long[N]
enough to get me here.[AN]
[OpenEyes]I'm looking for revenge, Lua.[N]
That, and a chance to make sure[N]
Yurena didn't die in that pit.[A]
[MR][2LB]
[Beat][CloseEyes]I'm sorry for your loss, Ruby.[AN]
I can only imagine what it's like[N]
to lose your whole crew like that.[AN]
[OpenEyes]But the Skysabers are[N]

We can't just work for free.[A]

Then take the Grapevine. My ship.[AN]

much more than driftwood.[A]
[MR][1LB]
You'd give it away so easily?[A]
[ML][2LB]

An island not far from here,[N]

I'll gather my crew and[N]

[MR][3LB]
[Beat]I'd say it's for the[N]

[CloseEyes]Really, I'm here because of[N]
your story about Yurena.[AN]
[Beat]I know what it's like, to[N]

Hey there. You're the captain[N]
who crashed her ship, right?[AN]
[MR]
Is that what Quispe's calling me?[N]
Kind of an annoying title, but[N]
whatever. What's it to you?[AN]
[ML]
The chief said that you might want[N]
to buy supplies, so I figured that[N]
I'd point you in the right direction.[AN]
See, outside of the village, we've[N]
got a little supply depot in case[N]
something happens to this place.[AN]
Normally, we wouldn't go around[N]
selling it to people, but you're[N]
lucky. The chief's approved it.[AN]
[MR]
And? I feel like there's some kind[N]
of catch that you're not telling me.[AN]
[ML]
Heh, you could say that. Thing is,[N]
there's a scuffle going on there.[N]
Pirates and imperials, seems like.[AN]
The chief's got no idea why they're[N]
here, but we all figured that it'd[N]
be best to let them kill each other.[AN]
But if we do that, then one of the[N]
two might win out and take our stuff.[N]
And that's where you guys come in.[AN]
[MR]
So we're supposed to risk our lives[N]

somehow. Anyway, follow me, captain.[AN]

feel free to talk to me again.[AN]

All its treasure is there for the[N]
taking, but naturally there's a catch.[AN]
Through some foul sorcery, the ghosts[N]

I've already got a buyer for the ship's[N]

Trained by an Imperial Healer, he says.[N]
Though, maybe he made it all up to fetch[N]

Please stop embarrassing me, captain![N]

[MidRight]
As well as I can, given the situation.[N]
Pilar, how's Windy's training going?[AN]
[FarLeft]
As well as it can. The girl's hardly[N]
ready[Beat] Before I left and joined[N]
your crew, she'd never held a blade.[AN]
[Left]
C-C'mon, granny! You don't have[N]
to tell the captain all of that.[AN]
[MidRight]
Ha[Beat] You're right, if only because[N]
I could see that the moment we met.[AN]
You're just like any other novice:[N]
shallow strikes, uncertain footing.[N]
Worse than I was as a beginner.[AN]
[Left]
Hey, I'm doing my best, alright?[AN]
I only started learning so that[N]
I'd be able to defend myself,[N]
once I left the village behind.[AN]
[FarLeft]
[Beat]Why did you decide to leave, Windy?[N]
This village is all you've known.[AN]
[Left]
That's why! Everybody else goes on[N]
about how the outside world's scary,[N]
or about our duties as Keepers[Beat][AN]
But how am I supposed to know how[N]
much any of that's worth til I go[N]
out and see the skies for myself?[AN]
[MidRight][Smile]
[Beat]That's a good answer, Windy.[N]
I'm surprised your [OQ]granny[CQ] here[N]
didn't reject you joining us, though.[AN]
[FarLeft]
Please. It's not my place to say.[N]
I'm not her real grandmother, after all.[N]
[Beat]That's who we're visiting, now.[AN]
[Left]
[Beat]My real family, besides her, never[N]
cared much for me. Granny here's the[N]
closest thing I've got, these days.[AN]
[MidRight]
[Beat]Is that so? Well, you're in good[N]
company. The crew's got plenty of[N]
people in a similar boat as you.[AN]
And hey, maybe with time, you'll[N]
think of the crew as a family,[N]
of a kind[Beat] I know that I do.[AN]
[Left]
Heh, I hope so! [Beat]Thanks again[N]
for taking me in, captain.[N]
I'll make it up to you.[AN]
[FarLeft]
Then you'd best get back to work.[AN]
And Lua[Beat] I know we're in an[N]
odd spot, but let me say this.[N]
I see the crew as family, too.[AN][CSSCF]

No, forget it. Not the time.[AN][X]

Hey, if it ain't the captain![N]
Come on over, boss. We've got an[N]
interesting little discussion, here.[AN]
[L]
[Beat]Interesting to whom? As I see it,[N]
this conversation is nothing more[N]
than persistent pestering from you.[AN]
[FL]
Now, now! No need to be so gloomy,[N]
Dmitr. We're all friends here, right?[N]
Fellow wanderers without a cause?[AN]
So, y'know[Beat] What's your story?[N]
Come on! Tell me all your secrets![A]
[FR]
[Beat]Seriously? Haven't I told you[N]
guys again and again not to pry?[N]
People's pasts are their own business.[AN]
[R]
Indio's just making it sound worse[N]
than it is. The two of us are just[N]
curious about a pal. Ain't that right?[AN]
[L]
I don't recall being any pal of yours.[N]
And captain, you misunderstand.[AN]
The "secrets" that these two seek[Beat][N]
They desire knowledge of the area,[N]
of interesting landmarks and such.[AN]
[FR]
[Beat]That's all? Why would they care[N]
about that? And why would you hide it?[AN]
[FL]
Come on, captain! We're in uncharted[N]
lands, but the natives refuse to share[N]
much of anything with us, you know?[AN]
We have to rely on each other to[N]
discover what this Old World is[Beat][AN]
And so, I figured that the three of us,[N]
kindred souls filled with wanderlust,[N]
should share our knowledge, y'know?[AN]
I even went first, out of good faith![AN]
[R]
Well, that's not really my area.[N]
I go where I please, but I couldn't[N]
care less about the sights, you see.[AN]
I'm only on Dmitr to pass the time.[N]
Food and drink, though? I've got[N]
plenty to say about that, haha![AN]
Have to hand it to these Keepers[Beat][N]
They make a damn good mug of ale.[AN]
[L]
[Beat]And as I've told Indio repeatedly,[N]
even if I had seen anything interesting,[N]
I wouldn't share it with them or anyone.[AN]
That way, no one will spoil the view,[N]
and its natural beauty will remain,[N]
unmarred by those with less respect.[AN]
[FR]
Hm[Beat] So you're saying that someone[N]
might mess with nature if you fess up[N]
and tell them about those landmarks.[AN]
At the end of the day, doesn't that[N]
mean that you don't trust these two?[N]
Even though you're in the same crew?[AN]
[L]
[Beat]Yes, I suppose that it does.[N]
Is that a problem, captain?[AN]
[FR]
Hm[Beat] No, I wouldn't say that.[N]
But you rely on these two to watch[N]
your back in a fight all the time,[AN]
but you can't trust them enough[N]
to share something interesting[N]
that you saw? Isn't that strange?[AN]
[L]
[Beat]Well, you do have a point.[AN]
Perhaps[Beat] I could show you both[N]
an interesting sight nearby,[N]
so long as you don't share it.[AN]
[FL]
For real? Of course! I'm there.[N]
Come on, Leandra. Let's go along[N]
on a little adventure, shall we?[AN]
[R]
H-Hey, hold on. I told you that[N]
I don't really care that much,[N]
didn't I? How about I go and you-[AN]
[FL]
Oh, stop trying to play the loner![N]
You're one of us too, Leandra.[N]
So you're not getting out of this![AN]
[R]
D-Damn it, let go already![AN]
[L][CSSCF][FL][CF][R][CF]

Nothing to say? How absurd![N]
After all that you've done,[N]
you mean to walk away?[AN]
[FarRight][LoadLua]
Hold on, what's this all about?[N]
You three fighting or something?[AN]
[R]
Wouldn't call it a fight[Beat][N]
But Hermen wanted something[N]
out of me. An apology, I guess.[AN]
[FL]
And I'm here because I found it[N]
interesting to watch her squirm,[N]
even if I've moved past her deeds.[AN]
[R]
Like I said before, your debt was[N]
all Sagargala's doing. I wouldn't[N]
ever give out that kind of money[Beat][AN]
Not to brats who'd never be able[N]
to pay it back. Not my style.[AN]
[L]
And what of me?! You gave me that gold,[N]
assuring me that the interest wouldn't[N]
mount beyond what I could afford![AN]
[R]
So? You're a grown man, Hermenegildo.[N]
Read the fine print before you sign,[N]
or you've got no right to complain.[AN]
[Beat]I heard that the captain let you[N]
loose from your debt. Must feel nice[N]
to be a free man again, right?[AN]
[L]
Well, I suppose[Beat] In all honesty,[N]
I've grown accustomed to servitude.[AN]
Even now, a little voice in the back[N]
of my mind reminds me of the words[N]
I might say, to ingratiate myself.[AN]
I hardly feel like a real man, yet.[AN]
[FL]
Captain[Beat] Why'd you dispense with[N]
my brother and I's debt immediately,[N]
while leaving Hermen to his chains?[AN]
[FR]
Because he earned his debt, Ondeh.[AN]
He lived beyond his means and tried[N]
to do it on someone else's dime.[N]
I've got no respect for men like that.[AN]
[L]
How unnecessarily harsh, captain[Beat][N]
Still, I cannot deny my folly.[AN]
[FR]
But with you and Biko, you took on[N]
debt to survive. There's nothing[N]
worth punishing in that, is there?[AN]
[FL]
[Beat]Back in Port Greagor, I would've[N]
disagreed. I always thought that our[N]
situation was my fault, and mine alone.[AN]
It was my debt to bear, and my brother[N]
got caught up in it[Beat] I hated myself.[AN]
[R]
[Beat] [Beat] [Beat][A]
[FL][ToggleSmile]
These days, I think about it this way:[N]
we'd have never met you, Captain Lua,[N]
if we hadn't taken on that debt.[AN]
So in the end, it wasn't all bad.[AN]
[L]
Ha! Spoken like a fool who's never[N]
witnessed the captain's true nature[Beat][N]
And yet, somehow, I feel the same.[AN]
[FR]
Heh[Beat] Well, if that's how you feel,[N]
then there's no need to hold what[N]
the Rioja Reapers did over Ruby's head.[AN]
Somehow or another, it all brought us[N]
together[Beat] Maybe one day, Ruby'll[N]
think the same way as you two.[AN]
[R]
Ha! Not likely, captain.[N]
I'm not a sap like them.[AN]
That said, sailing with[N]
you all[Beat] It'll pass[N]
the time, at least.[AN]
[FR]
Act tough all you want.[N]
One of these days, you'll[N]
slip up, and I'll see it.[AN]

going to let you forget it.[AN][X]

It makes enough sense, yeah.[N]
I can definitely see that you're[N]
new to this, though[Beat] Sloppy work.[AN]
[MidRight][LoadLua]
Hey, you two.[N]
How are the plans going?[AN]
[L]
Well enough. Like I said, we can't[N]
do much with them til we've got[N]
a ship again, but we've made progress.[AN]
[FL]
I drew up what this [OQ]auto-cannon[CQ] idea[N]
could look like, captain. I don't think[N]
me or Rahel can make it work on our own,[AN]
but maybe if we bring in other crewmates,[N]
we can get it done[Beat] at some point.[AN]
[MR]
Good to hear. If you two can really make[N]
a cannon that'll never miss its target,[N]
that'd help us in any future dogfights.[AN]
[L]
Not sure that [OQ]never[CQ] is possible,[N]
but with this design, the ammo'll fire[N]
much faster. That's half the battle.[AN]
Problem is, we don't really have[N]
a dedicated mechanist or anything,[N]
so Ximo's plans are[Beat] not great.[AN]
[FL]
Hey, I did the best that I could![N]
I've only ever made small gadgets,[N]
so this ain't my area, at all.[AN]
[MR]
Your area's being a swabbie[Beat][N]
Or, it used to be, anyway.[N]
You've come a long way, Ximo.[A]
[FL]
[Beat]Thanks, captain. Gotta admit,[N]
I'm still not sure that I'm worth[N]
your trust. I could screw up, y'know?[AN]
But taking this little hobby I had[N]
to the next level[Beat] It's been fun.[AN]
[L]
[Beat]Well, I've done my review now,[N]
but you should pass it around.[AN]
I'm sure other members of the crew'll[N]
have plenty to say about your design[Beat][AN]
And the more feedback that you get,[N]
the better this cannon'll be.[N]
Good luck on the project, Ximo.[AN]
[MR]
Hold on, Rahel. I'm assigning this[N]
to you, too. Ida taught you how to[N]
manage projects like this, yeah?[AN]
When you make it back to her,[N]
she'll be expecting that you[N]
used those talents of yours.[AN][ToggleSmile]
So add this to your portfolio.[AN]

What? But I've got other plans[Beat][N]
Ugh, fine. But if I get involved,[N]
then we've gotta redo these designs![AN]

No, no! I mean us meeting again,[N]

we'd meet on a battlefield again.[N]
And that I'd win, naturally![AN]
[L]
You're just assuming that we would've[N]

Well, whatever. You really haven't[N]

Hey, come on! Haven't you noticed how[N]

Still, the both of them had potential[N]
that I never got to see, as it happens.[AN]
After we stopped working together,[N]

Ha ha ha! It's true. The moment we went[N]

conquering each one of them with ease![AN]
[Beat]I admit, I had my doubts about[N]
my skills before that, but after?[N]
I knew that I was the real deal![AN]
[MR]
[Beat]The way you say it, this happened[N]
immediately after you left, right?[AN]
[FL]
Uh, yeah. What's that supposed to mean?[AN]
[MR]
Doesn't Kurt have horrible enough luck[N]
that it spreads to other people, even[N]
if they're allies? So, well[Beat] You know?[AN]
[L]
[Beat]You're saying it was my fault that[N]
they were both so terrible, captain?[N]

Uh[Beat] Just doing the rounds.[N]

What about you, Estelle, Leonor?[AN]

Estelle asked for my [OQ]expertise[CQ][N]
on what staves to purchase with[N]

Right! I feel like I've held my own[N]

Owe? You owe no debt to me, Estelle.[N]
You've been around longer than most,[N]

[FL]
Maybe, but they aren't very reliable[Beat][N]
And I've always felt that Razvan[N]

That's all that you owe me, understand?[AN]
[FL]
[Beat]Yes, captain. I understand![A]

W-Wait, captain! What about[N]
my gold for telling the truth?[AN]

It's balanced out by the 2000 gold[N]

No, I appreciate it, actually.[AN]
I'd been meaning to get a guard[N]
posted in front of my place,[N]
so you've done me a favor, really.[AN]
[FL]
A couple Keepers looked at the place[N]
funny, but otherwise, the coast's[N]
been pretty clear, Captain Lua.[AN]
[MR]
Good to hear. Still, what[N]
are you two doing here?[N]
Some kind of training session?[AN]
[L]
Ah, yes. Biko here sought me out,[N]
asking if I could show him how[N]
to hone his lancework further.[AN]
[FL]
And Mr. Ernest's been super helpful![N]
He could totally be a teacher,[N]
the way he explains stuff so easily.[AN]
[L]
Ha, I'm really not that great[Beat][N]
I grew up with six younger siblings,[N]
so I'm just used to it, I guess.[AN]
[MR]
Wow, six? That's quite the family.[N]
Do any of them know that you're[N]
still alive, or that you're a pirate?[AN]
[L]
Ah, well[Beat] Before the Roseblades[N]
fell apart, I always sent letters[N]
home and a bit of gold to help out.[AN]
Sometimes, I'd visit them, back at[N]
Port Greagor. My parents never[N]
approved much of my choices[Beat][AN]
But the look on my siblings' faces[N]
when I brought back little toys[N]
made their little comments worth it.[AN]
[Beat]They must think that I'm dead, now.[A]
[FL]
I get that you couldn't do much when[N]
you were back in Snowthorne, but maybe[N]
you should send another letter to them?[AN]
I know that if I hadn't heard from Ondeh[N]
in five years, then I'd be really sad.[AN]
[MR]
Biko's got the right of it[Beat][AN]
Not that I ever had a family[N]
to send letters to, or anything,[N]
but that's just what I think.[AN]
[L]
[Beat]You're right. I should've sent[N]
news back when we were in the outskirts,[N]
but I got trapped in my own thoughts[Beat][AN]
Once we accomplish our objective here,[N]
I'll send another letter to them.[N]
Maybe a souvenir from here, too.[AN]
The kids have all gotten older,[N]
though[Beat] Not sure what they'd like.[AN]
[FL][ToggleSmile]
Well, hey, maybe I can help you[N]
pick out something nice for them.[N]
We can start with some nice jams![AN]
[L]
Huh, do teenagers really like[N]
sweet jellies that much[Beat]?[N]
Well, we'll figure something out.[AN]
But that's a topic for after[N]
our training. Isn't it, Biko?[AN]
[FL]
Y-Yes! I'm ready, Mr. Ernest.[N]
Don't hold back, alright?![AN][CSSCF]
[L][CF]
[MR][ToggleSmile]
Ha[Beat] Must be nice, having people[N]
waiting for you back home. But I threw[N]
that away when I chose this life[Beat][AN]
No sense in crying over it now.[A][X]

I wasn't expecting anything,[N]

//Group 17: Ponte/Passarola/Bolton (two inventor/builders and Bolton, who's interested if they can make him something to help with his endurance)

[Right][LoadBolton]
Really? You guys can do that for me?[AN]
[FL][3LB]
Well, I dunno if it's a sure thing,[N]
but if we put our heads together,[N]
there ain't nothin' we can't make![AN]
[L]
Right you are, Ponte! I must say,[N]
it's wonderful having another[N]
reliable inventor around here![AN]
[FarRight][LoadLua]
Oh? You're an odd bunch.[N]
What's going on here?[AN]
[R]
These two stopped me just as I was[N]
heading back to my quarters, pooped[N]
after a very short ride around town.[AN]
Then they got to questioning me about[N]
my endurance. Some switch flicked in[N]
Passarola's eyes at something I said[Beat][AN]
And now, her and Ponte think that[N]
they can help me with my condition.[AN]
[L]
Honestly, it wouldn't be close to the[N]
top of my priority list, normally[Beat][AN]
But most of my plans went up in smoke[N]
when the armada crash landed here.[N]
So why not help a crewmate out, hm?[AN]
[R]
I see that everyone else in this crew[N]
is about as noble as I am, haha![N]
Anyway, I'm not expecting anything.[AN]
When you live with an issue like this[N]
long enough, you get used to it, y'know?[AN]
[FR]
No, I don't. I've been fit as a fiddle[N]
all my life. Never sick. But as your[N]
boss, I'd like to know more, at least.[AN]
What exactly is this condition?[AN]
[R]
Uh[Beat] I don't know if it's anything[N]
special, really. My family wasn't[N]
poor or anything. I've seen doctors.[AN]
None of 'em had much to say about[N]
it, except that I was born wrong.[AN]
[FL]
Ah man[Beat] That's tough, Bolton.[N]
Master Ida used to say the same[N]
thing to me, all the time![AN]
[FR]
No, that's[Beat] Never mind. Forget it.[N]
Is that what motivated you to become[N]
so proficient with magic, Bolton?[AN]
[R]
Could say that. I couldn't do[N]
much but read, most days.[AN]
Anything else would tire me right out[N]
in a few minutes and get my parents[N]
yelling[Beat] That's why I left home.[AN]
[FL]
You've had it so rough, man[Beat][N]
If ya ever need a shoulder[N]
to cry on, I'm here for ya![A]
[L]
Now, now, Ponte. He won't be needing[N]
to cry at all, once our combined[N]
genius starts to work its magic![AN]
[FR]
[Beat]I'm not sure if I should ask this,[N]
but how're you two going to stop[N]
the man from tiring out, exactly?[AN]
Doesn't really seem up your alley,[N]
based on everything I've seen so far.[A]
[L][ToggleSmile]
Ha! Everything in this world[N]
is up my alley, captain![AN]
I may not have an exact idea nailed[N]
down yet, but it will come, with time.[N]
Even if it takes years[Beat] Or decades![A]
[R]
Well, either way, I appreciate that[N]
you two are trying to give me hope.[N]
[Beat]This crew really is the place to be.[AN]
[FR]
And we're glad to have you, too.[N]
Hey, what do you say to a drink later,[N]
the four of us? Rounds are on me.[AN]

Wow! The stingy captain's even[N]
willing to be generous, huh[Beat][N]
Alright. Count me in, boss![A][X]

I only walked a little ways[N]

[Beat]Hm, there's a man over there.[N]
Hey, you! What's going on here?[AN]
[MidRight][LoadSoldier]
O-Oh, you're that new captain in town,[N]
right? Don't worry, this is normal[N]
around this time of year. Really![AN]
[ML]
Normal? Seriously? Well, whatever.[N]
If that's the case, then I've got[N]
no reason to hang around here.[AN]
[MR]
Hold on a second, please![N]
Erm[Beat] I heard you were taking[N]
requests. Mind hearing me out?[AN]
[ML]
I feel like I will soon,[N]
but go ahead. Shoot.[AN]
[MR]
Thanks! It's got to do with why[N]
I'm here in the first place. See,[N]
I've got a buddy named Windy.[AN]
We're both Keepers-in-training,[N]
so we spend a lot of time-[AN]
[ML]
I don't care about your backstory.[N]
Get on with the request before[N]
I change my mind and turn around.[AN]
[MR]
S-Sheesh, rude! Well, she went out[N]
into the fog on her own, so we got[N]
separated. I've been waiting here,[AN]
but I still haven't seen her come[N]
back, and there's no other way out.[AN]
[ML]
So you want me to go and look for her?[AN]
[MR]
Right! There's plenty of food around,[N]
so it's not like she'll starve or[N]
anything, but still, if you could[Beat][AN]
[ML]
If it's not urgent, then why can't you[N]
just do it yourself or have one of[N]
the other Keepers find this girl?[AN]
[MR]
Er[Beat] That's because I don't want them[N]
to find out what I've been up to here.[N]
See, I've always been fond of puzzles-[AN]
[ML]
Again? What did I say earlier?[AN]
[MR]
Fine! I set up a maze here before the[N]
fog set in, okay?! If the elder Keepers[N]
find out, I'll never hear the end of it![AN]
[Beat]A-Anyway, one more tip. Some of the[N]
obstacles should drift away soon, so[N]
the longer you wait, the easier it'll be.[AN]
It's already drifted beyond what I made[N]
before, so[Beat] I can't give you any[N]
instructions on the maze, either.[AN]
[ML]
How useless can you be[Beat][N]
And again, why are you sitting here[N]
instead of looking for your friend?[A]
[MR]
Because I'm afraid of the dark![N]
P-Please, just handle this.[N]
I'll even pay you for it![AN]

that you'd be somewhere in this maze.[N]
How are you keeping up? Hungry?[AN]

Please[Beat] Just bring me with you![A]
